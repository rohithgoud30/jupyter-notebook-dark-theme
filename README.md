# Dark theme for Jupyter Notebook (iPython 4)

This is a completely dark theme for the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) interface. Jupyter includes [iPython 4](http://ipython.org/) as its default kernel (which, confusingly, supports both Python 2.x and 3.x). Since the [iPython 3 to 4 transition](http://ipython.org/#jupyter-and-the-future-of-ipython), it has gained better support for [other interpreters](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages) like R and Ruby. It is possible to [upgrade](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html#upgrading) iPython 2 or 3 to Jupyter + iPython 4.

Source code coloring is based on the Twilight theme for Textmate.  Print preview output for notebooks retains a white background with printable foreground colors.

## Installing

To install this theme, copy or symlink `custom.css` into `~/.jupyter/custom/` (create that directory if it doesn't exist.) Then, whenever you run `jupyter notebook`, `iruby notebook`, etc. it will use this theme.

## Screenshots

All components of the notebook UI are themed, including the dialogs and menus. By default, I've hidden the toolbar, but you can reactivate this by commenting out the annotated line in `custom.css`.

The notebook list is themed as well.

For [ggplots](http://ggplot2.org/) that match the theme, I recommend using the dark HighCharts themes from [ggthemes](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes).
